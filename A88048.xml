         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">To the truly Noble from the Fountain victory, and ſomewhat more, Conquerours of Nobility, the Religious <hi>CRUMWEL,</hi> and the rest of the Council of VVarr.</head>
            <p>I Did think to Petition you: but what? to be valiant, honeſt, wiſe? that were to ſuppoſe you not ſo. Not ſo. God's given the Vote on your ſide.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be a Remonſtrance of the moſt horrid Monſters that ever eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. They ſay they are from God. Do you ſtartle?</p>
            <p>Will you fight them? Dare you fight them?</p>
            <p>You have fought with men and overcome; but dare you fight with Monſters? ſuch Monſters, do: for believe it, if you do not, if others ſhall, it will be ſung of you, as of <hi>Saul,</hi> his thouſand, and <hi>David</hi> his ten thouſand.</p>
            <p>I'le tell you their Names, and if you'l embrace the Adventure, I'le diſcover their Denns.</p>
            <p>The firſt the Law of <hi>England,</hi> (Treaſon! oh Treaſon!)</p>
            <p>The Law of <hi>England</hi> claims its Original from the Law of God: ſo that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not ſo, is void <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> by the Principles of Parliament, though nothing more contrary. If this fail, it claims its extract from Reaſon, yet nothing more unreaſonable; I'le prove it with my life, but then the Honour is mine, not yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jenkins</hi> the Judge, who is of the Countrey of Heralds, and (by Law) proves them Traytors that preſerve him, ingeniouſly confeſſeth their Pedigree from Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome or Preſident: then which, what more uncertain? what more wicked? what more unconſtant? what more Deviliſh?</p>
            <p>The other is Tythe Piggs, a Monſter too, far more dangerous then the wild Bore of the Forreſt.</p>
            <p>Will you fight them? ſay, I'le leave you this <hi>Momento;</hi> When the Parliament were ſo modeſt as to Petition the King 7 or 8 years leave to be juſt, they were at laſt compel'd to be ſo whether they would or no. If you ask leave to be valiant, to be honeſt, who will grant it you, but they that cannot hinder it? Be valiant, be wiſe, go on and proſper, you have the Prayers of the Worthies of the Nation.</p>
